### Data Types

* **Primitive** - byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean
* **Non-Primitive** (Reference data type) String, Array

## Java Programs ?

1. Leap Year
2. Armstrong Number
3. Prime Number
4. Twin Prime Number
5. Factorial of a Number
6. Fibonacci series

13. Innerclass/Outerclass
14. File Handling
15. String Inbuild Methods

## Q/A

1. What is Stack ?
2. Garbage Collector?
3. Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.
4. Shallow copy vs Deep copy

6. date class
7. anagram
8. Design pattern
9. recursion
10. sorting techniques
11. searching techniques
12. webserver architecture
13. Remove duplicates from an array
14. Printing patterns
15. The square root of a number
16. Reverse array in place
17. Reverse words of sentence
18. Binary search
19. String Anagram
20. Print all permutations of String

```java
//-------Important String Inbuild Methods--------//
// @formatter:off
String a = "some text";

charAt();

a.subString(2); // it display the string in 2nd position onwords
a.subString(2,4); // it display the 2nd position to 3rd position strings(in between Strings)

a.replace('a','f');
a.replaceAll('a','f');

a.contains('good');
a.toUpperCase();
a.toLowerCase();

a.join(" | ","Rubi","Anand",Charles); O/P :- Rubi | Anand | Charles

a="good morning to all"
a.split(" ")               O/p:- good
                                 morning
                                 to
                                 all
char c[]=a.toCharArray(); // it converts string to character arrays

a.matches("good") //it matches two strings and return boolean value
a.equals(b); //boolean result
a.equalsIgnoreCase(b);

a.startsWith("Go"); //boolean result
a.startsWith("Go",3); //boolean result
a.endsWith("od") // boolean result

a.indexof("h") // display the index num /else return -1
a.indexOf("h",3) // display the index num /else return -1
a.lastIndexOf("i") // display the index num /else return -1
a.lastIndexOf("h",3) // display the index num /else return -1
// @formatter:on
```

## Exceptions in Java

### ArithmeticException

It is thrown when an exceptional condition has occurred in an arithmetic operation.

### ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

It is thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater
than or equal to the size of the array.

### ClassNotFoundException

This Exception is raised when we try to access a class whose definition is not found

### FileNotFoundException

This Exception is raised when a file is not accessible or does not open.

### IOException

It is thrown when an input-output operation failed or interrupted

### InterruptedException

It is thrown when a thread is waiting , sleeping , or doing some processing , and it is interrupted.

### NoSuchFieldException

It is thrown when a class does not contain the field (or variable) specified

### NoSuchMethodException

It is thrown when accessing a method which is not found.

### NullPointerException

This exception is raised when referring to the members of a null object. Null represents nothing

### NumberFormatException

This exception is raised when a method could not convert a string into a numeric format.

### RuntimeException

This represents any exception which occurs during runtime.

### StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

It is thrown by String class methods to indicate that an index is either negative than the size of the string

### InputMismatchException

If you a are entering wrong datatype.

## Q1: equals() vs hashCode()

* They are used to compare if two objects are same or not.
* They are used in Hashing based data structures like Hashset, HashMap and HashTable.
* They are used in String.
* Both methods are part of Object class.
* hashCode() - It is used to create hash value for an object. Hash means a unique integer value that can be assigned to
  your object for its identification.

> Note:- As per the contract, whenever we override equals(), we must override hashCode() as well.

## Q2: How HashMap internally works ?

* Default capacity is 16.
* Internally HashMap contains array of LinkedList.
* HashMap uses Hashing.
* All the key value pairs are stored in Heap, only the address is stored in a bucket.

## Q3: What is String Constant Pool ?

String Constant Pool ia a special memory area designed only for Strings.
It's present inside Heap Space.

# Java Notes by Rubi raj Mani

## 1️⃣ How a Java Class will Load ?

1. Initializes **static variables**, Execute **static blocks**<br>
   📌Note: Static block **runs only once**, no matter how many objects you create.
2. Instance initialization blocks (Empty block)
3. Invoke Default Constructor, Parent class constructor is called first. super();

```text
Class loading (only once)
 ├─ Static variables
 └─ Static blocks

Object creation (every time)
 ├─ Memory allocation
 ├─ Parent constructor
 ├─ Instance variables
 ├─ Instance blocks
 └─ Constructor

```

## 2️⃣ Abstract class vs Interface

### Abstract class

* Contains both **abstract and non-abstract method**.
* abstract methods can have implementation details.
* Can extend class also implement interface's.

### Interface

* Only **abstract methods** are allowed (**only method signature**).
* After Java 8, **default** / **static** methods are allowed.
* Variables are by default (**public, static, final**)
* Can **extend only interface** (**multiple interface**) is possibe.

## 3️⃣ Method Overloading vs Overriding

<!-- @formatter:off -->
 ```java
print(int i);
print(long l);
print(String string);
add(int a, int b);
add(long a, long b);
```
<!-- @formatter:off -->

### 1️⃣ Hashtable vs Hashmap vs ConcurrentHashMap

| Hashtable | HashMap | ConcurrentHashMap |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Legacy    |         |                   |
