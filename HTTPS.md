# How Https encrypt data ?

## Encryption
* Symmetric Encryption
* Asymmetric Encryption

### Symmetric Encryption

* It uses a **single secret key** on both end to Encrypt and Decrypt information.
* It is **Old Encryption** method.
* It is **Fast** because of **single secret key**.
* It uses **AES (Advance Encryption System)**.

### Asymmetric Encryption

* It uses two keys **Public and Private key** to encrypt and decrypt information.
* **Public Key** is freely available to anyone who might want to send a message.
* Message encrypted using a **Public key can only decrypt using Private key**. (Public Key ➡️ Private Key)
* Also Message encrypted using a **Private key can only decrypt using Public key**. (Private Key ⬅️ Public Key)
* Due to this **MITM** is safe
* Encryption Algorithm it uses
  * RSA
  * PKCE- Proven key for Code Exchange

## TLS Handshake
* TLS (Transport Layer Security) 


## Abbreviation's
* Man in the Middle(MITM)
