What is Thread ?
	A thread = independent execution path inside same application.

What are the @FunctionalInterface available in Java ?
 * Runnable
 
ExecutorService
	Its a thread pool
	
Race Condition
	
@EnableAsync
@Async

1️⃣ Process vs Thread
OS
 └── Process (Java App)
       ├── Thread-1 (API request)
       ├── Thread-2 (API request)
       └── Thread-3 (Kafka consumer)

Parallel vs Concurrent


Thread t1 = new Thread();

What is Thread States ?

NEW				- new Thread()
RUNNABLE		- new Thread().start()
BLOCKED			- If another thread enters same block. Current thread in BLOCKED state (locked)
WAITING			- Thread waits indefinitely until another thread wakes it. Triggered by: object.join(); object.wait(); Thread sleeps forever until: object.notify();
TIMED_WAITING	- Waiting for specific time. Triggered by: Thread.sleep(1000); join(2000); wait(5000);
TERMINATED		- Thread finished execution.


start()
sleep()
join()
wait()
notify()

Executor Framework ?
Why Creating threads is expensive.

FixedThreadPool?
CachedThreadPool?
SingleThreadExecutor?
ScheduledExecutor?

What isCallable & Future?

What is volatile keyword ?

What is Locks API ?
ReentrantLock? 
ReadWriteLock?
Deadlock?

ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

lock.lock();
try {
   count++;
} finally {
   lock.unlock();
}


CompletableFuture ?
ForkJoinPool ?

final constructor is possible ?
why constructor is not having final ?

Mutual TLS (mTLS)
DPoP (Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession)

=========================

The circuit breaker has three states:

Closed:
In this state, the circuit breaker allows normal service communication, and requests go through to the service.
Circuit breaker monitors the responses from the service for errors. If the responses are successful with no issues, it remains in the closed state.

Open:
When the number of failures reaches a threshold, the circuit breaker switches to the open state, preventing requests from reaching the service and providing a fallback response.
(Threshold Value like 5 failures within 10 seconds)

Half-Open:
Once the timeout or reset interval passes, the circuit breaker goes to the “Half-Open” state.
It allows a limited number of test requests to pass through to the service to see if the service has recovered or not.
If the test requests succeed, it means the service has recovered and the circuit breaker goes back to “Closed” state.
If any of the test requests fails, it means the service has still issues and the circuit breaker goes to “Open” state to block further requests.
